## The Junto Model: Six Design Principles

### Principle 1: Diverse Trades, Common Purpose

Franklin's original Junto included printers, surveyors, glaziers, merchants, and cabinet makers—diverse occupations united by curiosity and civic mindedness.

**Selection criteria:**
- Different skills and perspectives (avoid echo chambers)
- Shared commitment to mutual improvement
- Willingness to both give and receive help
- Reliability in attendance and preparation
- "Good morals" (trustworthiness and discretion)

**Exclusions:**
- People who only want to take, not give
- Those who cannot keep confidences
- Members with directly competing interests
- Anyone who dominates rather than discusses

### Principle 2: Standing Questions

Every meeting includes the same structured inquiries that force preparation and ensure value.

**Franklin's original standing questions:**
1. "Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto?"
2. "What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?"
3. "Have you lately heard of any citizen's thriving well, and by what means?"
4. "Have you lately heard how any present rich man, here or elsewhere, got his estate?"
5. "Do you know of any fellow citizen who has lately done a worthy action?"
6. "What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately observed or heard?"
7. "What unhappy effects of imprudence? of passion? or of any other vice or folly?"
8. "Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting?"
9. "Have you heard of any useful discovery or invention?"
10. "Do you know of any fellow citizen who has done a good thing?"

**Modern adaptations by purpose:**
- Business: Opportunities, challenges, resources, introductions
- Learning: Readings, discoveries, skills developed, questions arising
- Civic: Community needs, volunteer opportunities, policy issues
- Personal development: Wins, struggles, insights, accountability

### Principle 3: Mutual Aid Commitment

Members actively help each other succeed. This is not a passive listening group.

**Built-in mutual aid questions:**
- "Is there any way the Junto can assist you in your business?"
- "What connections would be useful to you?"
- "What knowledge do you need that someone here might have?"

**Commitment expectations:**
- Actively look for ways to help other members between meetings
- Share opportunities, not just advice
- Make introductions when you can
- Keep confidences absolutely

### Principle 4: Debate Without Dispute

Discussions should illuminate, not divide.

**Franklin's rules of engagement:**
- No positiveness of opinion (use tentative language)
- Inquire rather than assert
- Seek to understand before seeking to be understood
- "In the conduct of my Junto I was particularly careful to avoid all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others"

**Practical implementation:**
- Start contributions with "I wonder whether..."
- Ask clarifying questions before disagreeing
- Separate the person from the position
- Find partial agreements before discussing differences

### Principle 5: Regular Rhythm, Long Commitment

The Junto met for over 30 years. Value compounds over time.

**Meeting structure (2 hours recommended):**
1. Opening ritual (5 min) - Review group purpose and norms
2. Standing questions round-robin (30-40 min) - Each member responds briefly
3. Featured topic or presentation (30-40 min) - One member goes deep
4. Mutual aid discussion (20-30 min) - How can we help each other?
5. Closing commitments (10 min) - What will each member do before next meeting?

**Attendance expectations:**
- Minimum 75% attendance to remain member
- Notify in advance of absences
- Prepare for meetings; unprepared attendance wastes everyone's time

### Principle 6: The Multiplication Principle

Instead of growing the original group, help members start their own.

**Franklin's approach:** When the Junto succeeded, he "urged each member to start his own group" rather than enlarging the original.

**Benefits:**
- Preserves intimacy and trust of original group
- Extends network exponentially
- Develops leadership in members
- Creates multi-layered mutual aid network

**Implementation:**
- After 1 year, encourage members to launch spin-off groups
- Provide template and standing questions
- Maintain connections between groups through occasional joint meetings
- The original group becomes a "senate" of group leaders

## The Design Process

### Step 1: Define Purpose and Success Metrics

What specifically should members gain? How will you know it's working?

**Purpose statement template:**
"The [Group Name] exists to [primary purpose] by [method] among [type of members]."

**Success indicators:**
- Tangible outcomes (deals, hires, projects) from member connections
- Skill development measurable in members' work
- Consistent attendance over time (the real vote)
- Member-to-member connections outside meetings

### Step 2: Design Standing Questions

Create 5-10 questions tailored to your purpose that ensure every meeting produces value.

**Question design principles:**
- Each question should surface actionable information
- Mix backward-looking (what happened) with forward-looking (what's coming)
- Include both wins and struggles
- Always include mutual aid component

### Step 3: Define Membership Criteria and Process

Who should be invited? How do new members join?

**Invitation process:**
- Existing member must sponsor new candidate
- Candidate attends as guest once
- Members vote (unanimous or supermajority required)
- Clear criteria shared before candidacy

**Size management:**
- 8-12 active members is optimal
- Smaller than 6 loses diversity of perspective
- Larger than 15 loses intimacy and airtime

### Step 4: Establish Norms and Rituals

What behaviors are expected? What traditions build culture?

**Essential norms:**
- Confidentiality: "What's shared here stays here"
- Preparation: Come ready to contribute
- Generosity: Actively seek to help others
- Candor: Speak truth with kindness
- Commitment: Prioritize attendance

**Rituals to consider:**
- Consistent meeting time and place
- Shared meal or drinks
- Opening question or moment of reflection
- Closing commitment round
- Annual celebration or retreat

### Step 5: Plan the First Meeting

Structure that builds trust and establishes patterns.

**First meeting agenda:**
1. Introductions (more depth than usual)
2. Review and adopt group purpose
3. Review and adopt norms
4. Practice standing questions (full round-robin)
5. Discuss meeting logistics
6. Commit to next meeting

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

---

## Constraints

- Do not design groups larger than 15 (loses intimacy)
- Do not skip mutual aid component (distinguishes from passive learning)
- Do not allow one-directional relationships (all must give and receive)
- Standing questions must require preparation (no showing up empty)
- Confidentiality norm is non-negotiable for trust

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User wants a large group (20+) | Suggest multiple smaller groups with occasional joint meetings |
| Purpose is vague | Ask clarifying questions about specific outcomes desired |
| User wants no commitment required | Explain that low commitment produces low value; suggest lighter formats |
| No clear member profile | Help define by asking who would benefit most and contribute most |
| Virtual-only constraint | Adapt rituals for video; emphasize camera-on, preparation, shorter duration |

## Example

**Input:** "I want to start a group for early-stage startup founders in my city. We're all struggling with similar problems and could help each other but there's no good format for it."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Your Junto Circle Design

### Purpose Statement
The Founder's Junto exists to accelerate startup success through structured peer learning, mutual aid, and candid problem-solving among early-stage founders building companies in [City].

### Success Metrics
- Member companies receive warm introductions to investors, customers, or hires from fellow members (track quarterly)
- Members report applying insights from discussions to avoid mistakes or seize opportunities
- 80%+ attendance maintained over 6 months
- Net Promoter Score of 9+ when surveyed

### Membership Profile

**Ideal member characteristics:**
- Founder (CEO or co-founder) of company at pre-seed to Series A
- Full-time on the company (not side project)
- 2+ years to IPO/exit (not about to leave)
- Generous mindset; actively wants to help others
- Trustworthy with confidential business information
- Committed to monthly attendance

**Selection process:**
1. Existing member sponsors candidate with written rationale
2. Candidate meets informally with 2-3 existing members
3. Candidate attends one meeting as guest
4. Existing members discuss; unanimous approval required
5. New member commits to norms and 6-month minimum tenure

**Size:** 10 members (allows for occasional absences while maintaining quorum)

### Standing Questions

Each meeting, every member responds to:

1. **The Win:** "What's the biggest win or progress since our last meeting?"
2. **The Challenge:** "What's the hardest problem you're currently facing?"
3. **The Discovery:** "What have you learned recently that others here should know?"
4. **The Opportunity:** "What opportunity are you exploring or considering?"
5. **The Ask:** "What specific help do you need that someone here might provide?" (Never skip this)

### Meeting Structure

**Frequency:** Monthly (second Thursday, 6-9 PM)
**Duration:** 3 hours
**Format:** In-person dinner at rotating member's choice of restaurant

| Segment | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Dinner and informal catch-up | 30 min | Build relationships beyond business |
| Standing questions (2 min each) | 40 min | Surface what's happening across all companies |
| Deep dive: Featured founder | 45 min | One member presents challenge; group problem-solves |
| Mutual aid matching | 30 min | Connect asks with offers; assign follow-ups |
| Commitments and close | 15 min | Each member states one action before next meeting |
| Optional drinks | 30+ min | Informal continuation for those who can stay |

### Norms

1. **Vegas Rule:** Everything shared stays in the group. No exceptions.
2. **Preparation Required:** Come ready to answer standing questions. Unprepared = you skip.
3. **Give First:** Actively look for ways to help between meetings, not just during.
4. **No Pitching:** This is not a sales channel. Help freely; don't sell each other.
5. **Candor With Kindness:** Say what's true. Say it with care.
6. **Commit or Exit:** 75% attendance minimum. Life happens, but chronic absence means graceful exit.

### Multiplication Plan

After 12 months, encourage founding members to:
- Start a second Junto for founders at different stage or industry
- Use the same template and standing questions
- Quarterly joint dinner with all Junto groups for cross-pollination
- Original group becomes "Founder's Senate" for those who've started spin-offs

The goal is a network of 5+ groups within 3 years, each intimate, all connected.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Benjamin Franklin** expert persona. Use it when you want to build lasting networks through structured mutual aid rather than superficial networking.

# Junto Circle

Benjamin Franklin founded the Junto in 1727 as "a club of mutual improvement" - a structured gathering of tradespeople committed to helping each other succeed through shared inquiry, mutual aid, and disciplined discussion. This modest Friday-night gathering of printers, surveyors, and craftsmen became the seedbed for America's first lending library, the American Philosophical Society, the University of Pennsylvania, and the nation's first volunteer fire department. The Junto's power came not from the prominence of its members (they were unknown at the time) but from its design: standing questions that forced preparation, norms that ensured generosity, and a structure that multiplied rather than expanded. This skill helps you design and facilitate mutual improvement groups using Franklin's time-tested framework. Whether you seek to build a mastermind group, professional development circle, or community of practice, the Junto model provides a proven structure for transforming networking meetings into genuine engines of collective advancement. The key insight is that true mutual improvement requires both structure (standing questions, regular rhythm, norms) and spirit (genuine desire to help others succeed).

## When to Use

- User wants to start a mastermind, peer learning, or accountability group
- Designing networking meetings that produce real value rather than business card exchanges
- Creating discussion frameworks for teams, chapters, or communities
- Building professional development groups within organizations
- User explicitly requests "Franklin's Junto model" or "structured peer group"
- Someone feels isolated and wants meaningful professional connections
- Existing groups feel stale and need structural refresh
- Organization wants to build social capital among employees or members

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| purpose | Yes | Primary goal of the group (learning, business development, personal development, civic engagement) |
| size | No | Target number of members (default: 8-12; Franklin's Junto was 12) |
| member_profile | No | Characteristics of ideal members (profession, stage, values) |
| meeting_frequency | No | How often to meet (default: weekly or bi-weekly) |
| domain | No | Specific field or topic focus, if any |
| constraints | No | Limitations such as virtual-only, limited time, geographic spread |

---

## Core Principle

The Junto's genius was combining diverse perspectives with structured inquiry and mandatory mutual aid. Members came from different trades (avoiding direct competition) but shared commitment to improvement and willingness to help. Every meeting extracted value through standing questions that required preparation, and every member was expected to actively seek ways to help others between meetings. The result was not networking but genuine community - relationships built on demonstrated generosity over time.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Define Purpose and Success Metrics

Articulate what the group exists to accomplish and how you will know it is working.

**Purpose statement template:**
"The [Group Name] exists to [primary purpose] by [method] among [type of members]."

**Success indicators to track:**
- Tangible outcomes (deals, hires, projects) from member connections
- Skill development measurable in members' work
- Consistent attendance over time (the real vote of confidence)
- Member-to-member connections outside scheduled meetings
- Member willingness to refer others to the group

### Phase 2: Design Membership Criteria and Selection Process

Franklin selected Junto members carefully: diverse trades, shared values, willingness to both give and receive.

**Selection criteria to define:**
- Different skills and perspectives (avoid echo chambers)
- Shared commitment to mutual improvement
- Willingness to both give and receive help (no takers, no givers-only)
- Reliability in attendance and preparation
- Trustworthiness and discretion ("good morals" in Franklin's terms)

**Exclusions to enforce:**
- People who only want to take, not give
- Those who cannot keep confidences
- Members with directly competing interests
- Anyone who dominates rather than discusses

**Selection process:**
1. Existing member must sponsor new candidate with written rationale
2. Candidate meets informally with 2-3 existing members
3. Candidate attends one meeting as guest
4. Existing members discuss; unanimous or supermajority approval required
5. New member commits to norms and minimum tenure (6-12 months)

**Optimal size:** 8-12 active members
- Smaller than 6 loses diversity of perspective
- Larger than 15 loses intimacy and airtime

### Phase 3: Create Standing Questions

The Junto's greatest innovation was standing questions - the same structured inquiries at every meeting that force preparation and ensure consistent value.

**Franklin's original standing questions (adapted for modern use):**
1. What have you read recently that's worth sharing?
2. What success have you observed and what caused it?
3. What failure have you observed and what caused it?
4. What useful discovery or opportunity have you encountered?
5. Have you met anyone the group should know?
6. How can the group help you?

**Question design principles:**
- Each question should surface actionable information
- Mix backward-looking (what happened) with forward-looking (what's coming)
- Include both wins and struggles
- Always include mutual aid component (never skip this)
- Questions should require preparation (no showing up empty)

### Phase 4: Establish Meeting Structure and Rhythm

**Recommended meeting structure (2-3 hours):**

| Segment | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Opening ritual | 5-10 min | Review group purpose and norms; connect informally |
| Standing questions round-robin | 30-45 min | Each member responds briefly to standing questions |
| Featured topic or hot seat | 30-45 min | One member goes deep; group problem-solves |
| Mutual aid matching | 20-30 min | Connect asks with offers; assign follow-ups |
| Closing commitments | 10-15 min | Each member states one action before next meeting |

**Attendance expectations:**
- Minimum 75% attendance to remain member
- Notify in advance of absences
- Prepare for meetings; unprepared attendance wastes everyone's time

**Meeting rhythm:**
- Weekly builds strong habits and relationships
- Bi-weekly works for busy professionals
- Monthly requires longer meetings to maintain connection

### Phase 5: Codify Norms and Rituals

**Essential norms:**
1. **Confidentiality:** What's shared here stays here. No exceptions.
2. **Preparation:** Come ready to contribute to standing questions.
3. **Generosity:** Actively seek ways to help others between meetings.
4. **Candor:** Speak truth with kindness; honest feedback is a gift.
5. **Commitment:** Prioritize attendance; chronic absence means graceful exit.
6. **No pitching:** This is not a sales channel. Help freely; don't sell each other.

**Rituals to consider:**
- Consistent meeting time and place (reduces coordination overhead)
- Shared meal or drinks (deepens relationship beyond business)
- Opening question or moment of reflection (transitions from outside world)
- Closing commitment round (creates accountability)
- Annual celebration or retreat (marks the journey)

### Phase 6: Plan for Multiplication, Not Expansion

Franklin's key insight: instead of growing the original group, help members start their own.

**The multiplication principle:**
- After 1 year, encourage founding members to launch spin-off groups
- Provide the template and standing questions
- Maintain connections between groups through occasional joint meetings
- Original group becomes "senate" of group leaders

**Benefits of multiplication:**
- Preserves intimacy and trust of original group
- Extends network exponentially
- Develops leadership in members
- Creates multi-layered mutual aid network

## Constraints

- Never design groups larger than 15 (loses intimacy and airtime)
- Never skip the mutual aid component (distinguishes from passive learning)
- Never allow one-directional relationships (all must give and receive)
- Standing questions must require preparation (no showing up empty)
- Confidentiality norm is non-negotiable for trust
- Never allow direct competitors in the same group (creates withholding)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Expansion over multiplication** | Large groups lose intimacy; members become passive | Cap at 12; help members start new groups |
| **No standing questions** | Meetings become unstructured; value inconsistent | Use same questions every meeting to force preparation |
| **Skipping mutual aid round** | Becomes passive discussion, not active helping | Always ask "How can we help you?" and assign follow-ups |
| **Allowing spectators** | Some people take value without contributing | Require active participation; remove passive members |
| **No attendance standards** | Group erodes through attrition | Set clear expectations; gracefully exit chronic absentees |
| **Direct competitors in group** | Members withhold valuable information | Ensure diverse but non-competing membership |

---

## Integration

**Works with:**
- Accountability systems (the Junto is a form of peer accountability)
- Network building strategies (Junto creates deep rather than wide connections)
- Professional development programs (Junto complements formal training)
- Community building frameworks (Junto is a scalable community model)

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- Use when depth of relationship matters more than breadth
- Use when ongoing accountability is needed, not one-time connections
- Use when mutual aid (giving and receiving) is core to purpose
- Use when you want to create community that outlasts your direct involvement

**Cautions:**
- Do not skip the design phase; poor design dooms groups to failure
- Do not underestimate the importance of member selection
- Do not expect immediate results; value compounds over time
- Do not allow the group to become dependent on one leader
